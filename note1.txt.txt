Git push:
when we want our local repository to our git hub
we have to do 3 steps 
first is adding
second is commit 
and then push
In adding, we will add our required file from local machine to staging area they will be ready to be commited.
In commit we need to move the file from staging area to our local git repository.
After the above two step we can push file from git repository.

Now you are aware with these commands:
git add <file name> adding a file to staging area
git commit -m 'some message' commiting the file for push
git push origin master pushing the commited file to git hub
